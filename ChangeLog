	(Thanks to Bernard Blundell <blundell@lts.sel.alcatel.de>)

	Stupid GCC "warning: return type of `main' is not `int'" removed.



3.0	Tue Oct 14 14:20:52 MET DST 1997

	Added a new option "-r" to force a relaxed security and
	so make a redistributable binary.

	Modified expiration day format. Now is dd/mm/yyyy.



3.0b3	Fri Jun  6 22:09:05 WET DST 1997

	Yet other few bugs fixed.
	Output format simplified.
	-pedantic compilation.



3.0b2	Tue Jun  3 17:51:51 GMT 1997

	Some explicit type conversions removed.

	Fixed the bug "END_OF_FILE" when compiling the generated code.
A flush is needed before a pclose.

	st_blksize and st_blocks struct stat fields does not exist on
SCO, both not used now.



3.0b1	Wed Feb 26 14:27:22 WET 1997

	The main difference with 2.4 is that in it the script was
compressed an then shuffle around, now int 3.0 the script is encrypted
with an inline code, so not needing any external command to work, and been
faster at startup. Other related advantage is that the only information
not encrypted in .x.c is an stamp, expiration date and provider email
address.

	Something equivalent to checksums have been used to enforced at
execution that the executing shell has not been modified from the time
the script was compiled. If anybody tries to change the executing shell,
.x will refuse to execute.

	The generated .x.c source code is now readable.
